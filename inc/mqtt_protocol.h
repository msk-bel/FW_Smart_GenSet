//===================================================================================
//----------------------------    $ Version - 1.0 $  ------------------------------//
//This File and its header file contains code that can act perform like an MQTT
//Stack for low-end (resource starving) micro-controllers. This MQTT Library is only
//for Client Device and can be used on top of TCP/IP Stack. It handles MQTT Packets
//formation and proper connection settings for MQTT broker. Before using this library,
// one has to establish a TCP/IP connection to Broker/Server via Wifi, GPRS, or any
//other networking protocol.
